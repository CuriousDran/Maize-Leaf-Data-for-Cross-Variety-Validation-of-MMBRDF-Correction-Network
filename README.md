Introduction:
  Presenting curated maize MMBRDF model parameter data for three sampled varieties (B73, MO17, and Pioneer Hybrid). ​ A total of 25 samples were collected for each variety with the top five leaves of each of five plant samples are presented for all three varieties. ​ (i.e. B73 Plant 1-5 Leaf 1-5). ​ All samples were grown outdoors at Central Crops Research Station (CCRS) in Clayton, NC in the summer of 2024 ​
Publication in progress: "Cross-Variety Validation of a Polarimetric Glare Correction Algorithm for Maize" ​
